I migrated the GitHub repo to an organisation one, meaning setting up (again) all the continuous integration.
I implemented a first basic version of the firebase database.

The firebase setup went well.

I underestimated the time needed for dealing with GitHub and continuous integration.
I started implementing too many function for database. I had to reduce the scope to be able to test them correctly.
