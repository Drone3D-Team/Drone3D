I migrated the GitHub repo to an organisation one, meaning setting up (again) all the continuous integration.
I implemented a first basic version of the firebase database.

The firebase setup went well.

I underestimated the time needed for dealing with GitHub and continuous integration.
I started implementing too many function for database. I had to reduce the scope to be able to test them correctly.

I created a figma to have a plan we can use to create the applications of the app in the future.
I created the main menu of the app

The creation of the figma went well, without any hitch.
The creation of the main menu went well until I tried to merge it where I had two problems : first I had to change the setup of codeclimate
because the functions creating the added applications and the functions called on button press where too close to each other. Then I had a
problem because cirrus uses a smaller screen than the one I used, and I didn't setup the buttons to adapt their positions and sizes to the 
screen.
